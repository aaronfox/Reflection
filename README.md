# Reflection
## A 2D puzzle game created using Unity

The goal of the game is to strategically place tiles so that the ball can reflect off of the tiles and walls (the number of reflections are limited) and land the ball in the end goal, beating that level.

The game is currently being developed and graphically hideous, but the game mechanics are getting there!
